# -CTC-Prediction-Project
CTC Prediction Project
Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the Cost-to-Company (CTC) for newly hired employees based on various features such as educational background, prior work experience, and location. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, and it leverages libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

Goals
Develop a regression model to accurately predict employee CTC.
Analyze relationships between input features and CTC.
Enhance organizational efficiency by providing data-driven salary predictions.
Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline for handling missing values and categorical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.
Regression modeling using algorithms such as:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
