# 🚀 **CTC Prediction Project**  

## 📝 **Overview**  
This project involves building a machine learning model to **predict the Cost-to-Company (CTC)** for newly hired employees based on various features such as educational background, prior work experience, and location. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.  

---

## 🎯 **Goals**  
- 🏆 **Develop** a regression model to accurately predict employee CTC.  
- 📊 **Analyze** relationships between input features and CTC.  
- ⚡ **Enhance organizational efficiency** by providing data-driven salary predictions.  

---

## 🌟 **Features**  
- 🧹 **Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline** for handling missing values and categorical data.  
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and correlations.  
- 🤖 **Regression modeling** using algorithms such as:  
  - **Linear Regression**  
  - **Decision Tree**  
  - **Random Forest**  
- 📈 **Performance evaluation** using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.  
- ⚙️ **Hyperparameter tuning** to improve model performance.  

---

## 📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset includes the following columns:  
- 🏫 **College**  
- 🌆 **City**  
- 💼 **Role**  
- 💰 **Previous CTC**  
- 🔄 **Previous job change**  
- 🎓 **Graduation marks**  
- 🕒 **Experience in months**  
- 💵 **CTC**
